# CSS Layout

## HTML & CSS - Jon Duckett

- **Chapter 15: Layout**

  - Building blocks
  
    - Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout

      - Examples: < h1 >, < p >, < ul >, < li >

    - Inline boxes flow between surrounding text

      - Examples: < img >, < b >, < i >

  - Containing elements

    - If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is knon as the containing or parent element

  - The float property moves conent to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts

  - Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts

  - Grids help make pages look professional and flexible

  - CSS frameworks provide rules for common tasks

    - Create layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of each page, etc
