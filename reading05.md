# Images, Color, Text

## HTML & CSS - Jon Duckett

- **Chapter 5: Images**

  - Adding images to HTML file are done by using the <img> element

    - Example: <img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A Family of quokka"/>

      - The SRC tells the browser where it can find the image file.

      - The ALT provides a text dscription of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it

- **Chapter 11: Color**

  - Color brings your site to life

  - There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB, hex, and color names

- **Chapter 12: Text**

  - There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing

  - You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left right, center, justified, or indented

- **Blog Post: JPEG vs PNG vs GIF**

  - TL;DR

    - "Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations."
