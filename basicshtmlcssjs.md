# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## HTML & CSS - Jon Duckett

- **Chapter 2: Text**

  - Structural Markup

    - The elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs

  - Semantic markup

    - Provides extra info; such as where empahsis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation, the meaning of acronyms, and so on

- **Chapter 10: Introducing CSS**

  - CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example: you can specify that the background of a page is cream, all paragraphs should be gray using a specific font, or that all level one headings should be blue, italic, and bold

  - CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the contnet of specified elements should look on your web page

    - Treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and usses rules to indicate how each element should look

    - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements
  
  - CSS rules usually appear in a separtate docutment, although they may appear withing an HTML page

## JavaScript - Jon Duckett

- **Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions**

  - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe
  
  - Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you miight specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that variable

  - Variable are used to temporarily store pieces of info used in the script

  - Arrays are special types of variable that store more than one piece of related info

  - JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, 0-9, strings, text, and Boolean values, true or false

  - Expressions evaluate into a single value

  - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value

- **Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops**

  - Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next

  - Comparison operators are used to compare two operands
  
    - Examples: ===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>

    - The operand does not have to be a single value or variable name. It can be an expression
  
  - Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators

  - if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false
