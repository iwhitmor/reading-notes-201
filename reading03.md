# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML & CSS - Jon Duckett

- **Chapter 3: Lists**

  - Three types of HTML lists

    - Ordered lists

      - Lists where eacah item in the list is numbered
  
    - Unordered Lists

      - Lists that begin with a bullet point (not numbers)
  
    - Definition Lists

      - Made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms

    - Lists can be nested inside one another

- **Chapter 13: Boxes**

  - CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box

  - Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control appearance: border, margin, and padding

  - Padding and margin are helpful in adding space between various items on the page

  - Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes

## JavaScript - Jon Duckett

- **Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions**

  - Arrays

    - An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values

    - Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is imporant to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero, and not one

- **Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops**

  - If...Else statements

    - The if...else statement checks a condition

  - Switch Statements

    - Starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the cod ethat run if the variable matches that value

  - Loops and Loop counters

    - Loops check a condition. If it returns TRUE, a code block will run. It repeats until the conditions returns FALSE

      - Three types of loops: FOR, WHILE, and DO WHILE

        - A FOR LOOP uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified number of times
