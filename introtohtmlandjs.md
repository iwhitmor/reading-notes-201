# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## HTML & CSS - Jon Duckett

- Chapter 1: Structure

  - HTML describes the struture of pages and uses elements to describe that structure
  
  - Tags act like containers. They tell you what the information is inbetween their tags

  - Tags come in pairs and are often referred to as elements

  - Attributes require both a name and value

- Chapter 8: Extra Markup

  - Doctypes tell broswers what version of HTML you are using

  - You can add comments in your code between the '< !-- and -- >' markers

  - The id and class attributes allow you to identify partiular elements

  - The DIV and SPAN elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together

- Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

  - HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page

  - The new elements provide clearer code compared to using multiple DIV elements

- Chapter 18: Process & Design

  - Every website should be designed for the target audience, not just yourself

  - You need to define why people are going to visit your website. Some might stumble upon it, but most will be visiting to find certain information

  - Good ways to start to organize your website is by using site maps and wireframes

## JS & JQuery - Jon Duckett

- JS Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming

  - Computers create models of the world using data
  
  - Programmers can write code to say, "When this event occurs, run that code"

  - Browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page

  - To make the webpage interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page

  - Web developers usually use three languages that are used to create web pages

    - HTML = Content layer

    - CSS = Presentation layer

    - JS = Behavior layer

  - It is best to keep JS cod ein its own JS file

  - The HTML SCRIPT element is used in HTML to tell the browser to load the JS file
