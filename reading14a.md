# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

- **Transforms**

  - The transform property can be used in 2D and 3D

    - Each of these come with their own individuals properties

  - Browser support for using transform is not very good, however it is getting better every day

    - You may have to download a different version of chrome in order to use it to its full functionality

- **Transitions and Animations**

  - CSS3 implemented the ability to use transitions and animations. You have the ability to change the appearance and behavior of an element when you do multiple things like: hover over, focus on, active, or targeted

  - We use animations when we want more detail than just a transition

  - With transitions, you can make an element do something where it sits on the page. With animations, you can make something on your page move around

  - Some examples of transitions:

    - Fade in

    - Change color

    - Grow & shrink

    - Rotate elements

    - Square to circle

    - 3D shadow

    - Swing

    - Inset border
